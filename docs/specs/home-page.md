# Home page

The home page should be the first page user access when visiting the website.

It should display a list of games that include game thumbnail, game name, and a **Play** button.

For now there's only one game called Tic-Tac-Toe.

Clicking on the Play button under game name should bring user to the [Game page](./game-page.md).
